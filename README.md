COVID-19 Analysis Dashboard
Overview
The COVID-19 Analysis Dashboard project is focused on analyzing pandemic-related data to drive insights into infection rates, recovery rates, and vaccination progress. The project uses data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive overview of the pandemic's impact through various statistics and visual representations.

Key Components
Data Understanding
Analysis of infection rates, recovery rates, and vaccination progress across different regions.

Evaluation of key statistics such as death rate, new deaths, new cases, recovery rate, active cases, total recovered, and new recovered.

Data Cleaning
Preparation of clean datasets from original raw data, including datasets on infections, recoveries, and vaccinations.

Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency across the datasets.

Data Modeling
Aggregate score calculations, region-wise categorization, and workflow optimization.

Establishing relationships between various datasets to enable seamless analysis and cross-filtering.

Data Analysis
Insights into the top-affected regions and trends in infection and recovery rates.

Detailed analysis of vaccination progress and its impact on the pandemic.

Visualization
Dashboards and charts created using Power BI/Tableau for strategic decision-making.

Visual representations include bar charts, pie charts, and interactive maps.

Key Objectives
Analyze Infection Rates: Identify regions with the highest and lowest infection rates.

Assess Recovery Rates: Understand how different regions are recovering from the pandemic.

Evaluate Vaccination Progress: Track the progress of vaccination campaigns and their impact on infection and recovery rates.

Provide Recommendations: Based on the data, provide actionable recommendations to help mitigate the impact of the pandemic.

Datasets Used
Infection Dataset
Columns: Region, Date, New Cases, Total Cases, Active Cases

Describes the infection rates and active cases across different regions.

Recovery Dataset
Columns: Region, Date, New Recoveries, Total Recoveries

Data Analysis and Visualization
Visualization 1: Bar chart comparing total cases, total deaths, and total recoveries across regions.

Visualization 2: Pie chart visualizing the distribution of key statistics such as death rate, new deaths, and recovery rate.

Interactive Maps: Geographical visualization categorizing regions into Red Zone, Safe Zone, etc.

Key Insights
Infection Rates
Identification of top-affected regions with the highest infection rates.

Recovery Rates
Analysis of regions with the highest recovery rates and successful mitigation strategies.

Vaccination Progress
Evaluation of regions with the highest vaccination rates and their impact on infection and recovery rates.

Conclusion
The COVID-19 Analysis Dashboard project successfully uncovers key insights into the pandemic's impact by analyzing infection, recovery, and vaccination data. Through data cleaning, feature engineering, and visual analysis, we identify top-affected regions and understand trends in infection, recovery, and vaccination. Our findings highlight the value of targeted strategies to mitigate the pandemic's impact and improve public health outcomes.
