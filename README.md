Overview
The COVID-19 Analysis Dashboard project is focused on analyzing pandemic-related data to drive insights into infection rates and recovery rates. The project uses data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive overview of the pandemic's impact through various statistics and visual representations.

Key Components
Data Understanding

Analysis of infection rates and recovery rates across different regions.

Evaluation of key statistics such as death rate, new deaths, new cases, recovery rate, active cases, total recovered, and new recovered.

Data Cleaning

Preparation of clean datasets from original raw data, including datasets on infections and recoveries.

Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency across the datasets.

Data Modeling

Aggregate score calculations, region-wise categorization, and workflow optimization.

Establishing relationships between various datasets to enable seamless analysis and cross-filtering.

Data Analysis

Insights into the top-affected regions and trends in infection and recovery rates.

Detailed analysis of the pandemic's impact on different regions.

Visualization

Dashboards and charts created using Power BI/Tableau for strategic decision-making.

Visual representations include bar charts and interactive maps.

Key Objectives
Analyze Infection Rates: Identify regions with the highest and lowest infection rates.

Assess Recovery Rates: Understand how different regions are recovering from the pandemic.

Provide Recommendations: Based on the data, provide actionable recommendations to help mitigate the impact of the pandemic.

Datasets Used
Infection Dataset

Columns: Region, Date, New Cases, Total Cases, Active Cases

Describes the infection rates and active cases across different regions.

Recovery Dataset

Columns: Region, Date, New Recoveries, Total Recoveries

Contains data on the number of recoveries from COVID-19 across different regions.

Project Workflow
Data Understanding

Exploration of dataset structures and contents to gain insights into infection and recovery trends.

Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features such as daily infection rates and recovery ratios to facilitate better analysis.

Data Modeling

Establishing relationships between infection and recovery datasets for comprehensive analysis.

Data Analysis and Visualization

Visualization 1: Bar chart comparing total cases, total deaths, and total recoveries across regions.

Visualization 2: Cards visualizing the distribution of key statistics such as death rate, new deaths, and recovery rate.

Interactive Maps: Geographical visualization categorizing regions into Red Zone, Safe Zone, etc.

Key Insights
Infection Rates

Identification of top-affected regions with the highest infection rates.

Recovery Rates

Analysis of regions with the highest recovery rates and successful mitigation strategies.

Conclusion
The COVID-19 Analysis Dashboard project successfully uncovers key insights into the pandemic's impact by analyzing infection and recovery data. Through data cleaning, feature engineering, and visual analysis, we identify top-affected regions and understand trends in infection and recovery. Our findings highlight the value of targeted strategies to mitigate the pandemic's impact and improve public health outcomes.
